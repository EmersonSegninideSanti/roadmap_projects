Purple Circle Positioning Instructions:

To determine the lateral positioning of the circles, we must calculate the width of the left column ("cl-left-column") minus half the width of the circle ("cl-circle"). The result is the value assigned to the left positioning attribute of the 'cl-circle' class. 
This solution to the positioning problem doesn't seem ideal to me, but it's what I could think of.
